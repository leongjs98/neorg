Handles the creation and management of Neovim's autocommands.

# Overview

This internal module exposes functionality for subscribing to autocommands and performing actions based on those autocommands.

###### NOTE: This module will be soon deprecated, and it's favourable to use the `vim.api*` functions instead.

In your `module.setup()`, make sure to require `core.autocommands` (`requires = { "core.autocommands" }`)
Afterwards in a function of your choice that gets called *after* core.autocommmands gets intialized (e.g. `load()`):

```lua
module.load = function()
    module.required["core.autocommands"].enable_autocommand("VimLeavePre") -- Substitute VimLeavePre for any valid neovim autocommand
end
```

Afterwards, be sure to subscribe to the event:

```lua
module.events.subscribed = {
    ["core.autocommands"] = {
        vimleavepre = true
    }
}
```

Upon receiving an event, it will come in this format:
```lua
{
    type = "core.autocommands.events.<name of autocommand, e.g. vimleavepre>",
    broadcast = true
}
```
