The `promo` module increases or decreases the nesting level of nestable items by repeating their characters.

# Overview

When dealing with Norg, it may sometimes be tedious to continually repeat a single character to increase
your nesting level. For example, for a level 6 nested unordered list, you need to repeat the `-` character
six times:
```norg
------ This is my item!
```

The `core.promo` module allows you to indent these object by utilizing the inbuilt Neovim keybinds:
- `>>` - increase the indentation level for the current object (also dedents children)
- `<<` - decrease the indentation level for the current object recursively (also dedents children)
- `>.` - increase the indentation level for the current object (non-recursively)
- `<,` - decrease the indentation level for the current object (non-recursively)

In insert mode, you are also provided with two keybinds, also being Neovim defaults:
- `<C-t>` increase the indentation level for the current object
- `<C-d>` decrease the indentation level for the current object

This module is commonly used with the [`core.itero`](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki/Itero) module for an effective workflow.
