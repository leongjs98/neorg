# `core.export.markdown`

### Neorg's Markdown Exporter





</div>

# Overview

This module exists as an interface for `core.export` to export `.norg` files to Markdown.
As a user the only reason you would ever have to touch this module is to configure *how* you'd
like your markdown to be exported (i.e. do you want to support certain extensions during the export).
To learn more about configuration, consult the [relevant section](#configuration).

# Configuration

* <details open>
  
  <summary><h6><code>extension</h6></code> (string)</summary>
  
  <div>
  
  Used by the exporter to know what extension to use
  when creating markdown files.
  The default is recommended, although you can change it.
  
  </div>
  
  ```lua
  "md"
  ```
  
  </details>

* <details open>
  
  <summary><h6><code>extensions</h6></code> (empty list)</summary>
  
  <div>
  
  Any extensions you may want to use when exporting to markdown. By
  default no extensions are loaded (the exporter is commonmark compliant).
  You can also set this value to `"all"` to enable all extensions.
  The full extension list is: `todo-items-basic`, `todo-items-pending`, `todo-items-extended`,
  `definition-lists`, `mathematics` and 'metadata'.
